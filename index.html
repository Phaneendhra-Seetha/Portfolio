    <div class="about-content">
        <p>I'm a Data/Business with around two years of experience, primarily working in startups.

Throughout my career, I have successfully worked on 20+ client-facing projects, delivering impactful solutions that enhance decision-making and operational efficiency. I love turning data into meaningful insights using tools such as SQL(Structured Query Language), Microsoft Excel, and other Data Visualisation tools(Power BI, Tableau). My focus is on making data work for businesses, helping them make informed decisions through clear and actionable solutions.

        <div id="more-info" style="display: none;">
            <p>In my previous role, I used SQL, Excel, PowerBI, Python on a daily basis to build reports and dashboards. I also have got hands-on with building and implementing solutions on a no-code low-code environment. </p>
            <p>I hold a MTech degree from NIT Warangal and BE Degree from Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology(CBIT), and outside of work, I enjoy dancing and Audio-Mixing. I believe these activities help me stay creative and innovative both professionally and personally.</p>
